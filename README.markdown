# Message Owl


## Message Owl: Eclipse JMS Queues and Topics Tool

*Message Owl* is an [Eclipse](http://www.eclipse.org) based tool that helps Eclipse-wielding humans to interact with [JMS](http://java.sun.com/products/jms/)-based message queues. 

*Message Owl* can be added to any installation of [Eclipse 3.5](http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages) that already contains the [Web Tools Platform](http://www.eclipse.org/webtools). If you are starting from scratch, the easiest approach is to download the [Eclipse IDE for Java EE Developers](http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages) - it contains everything you will need, plus a lot more besides.

*Message Owl* is distributed as a [p2 update site](http://github.com/oisin/Message-Owl/downloads) and is easily installed using the Eclipse <tt>Help &gt; Install New Software</tt> action.

*Message Owl* was previously part of the FUSE Integration Designer product, which has ceased development. Original authors are *sgupta* and *kiranb*, both Eclipse developers in Progress Software's Hyderabad office. Good work guys!
