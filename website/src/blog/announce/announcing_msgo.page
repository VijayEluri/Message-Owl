Announcing Message Owl - an Eclipse-based tool for human interaction with JMS Queues and 
Topics.

We're just in the planning stage here and getting our house in order for consumption with
build instructions, downloads and the like. The first developer download should be available
towards the end of February 2010. 

Until then you can still browse the [source](../../source.html) as it currently stands.
