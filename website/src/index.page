## Message Owl: Eclipse JMS Queues and Topics Tool

*Message Owl* is an [Eclipse](http://www.eclipse.org) based tool that helps Eclipse-wielding humans to interact with [JMS](http://java.sun.com/products/jms/)-based message queues. 

*Message Owl* can be added to any installation of [Eclipse 3.5](http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages) that already contains the [Web Tools Platform](http://www.eclipse.org/webtools). If you are starting from scratch, the easiest approach is to download the [Eclipse IDE for Java EE Developers](http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages) - it contains everything you will need, plus a lot more besides.

*Message Owl* is distributed as a [p2 update site](download.html) and is easily installed using the Eclipse <tt>Help &gt; Install New Software</tt> action.

## Getting started

Visit the [download page](download.html) for instructions on how to update your Eclipse installation.

Check out the [user guide](documentation/index.html) for information on how to drive it.

You can always ask questions and find more detailed information on [the mailing lists](community.html).

## Found a bug?

Run - don't walk - to our [JIRA bugtracker](http://fusesource.com/issues/browse/MSGO) to report the issue. You will need to log in to the JIRA before you can make the report - this is our way of stopping the JIRA instance being spammed into oblivion by porn-peddlers and hawkers of dodgy chemical enhancements. It's quick and easy to [register and set up a login](https://fusesource.com/login).

## What's going on right now?

The usual open-source stuff, fixing
the build, fixing the website,
fixing the JIRAs, maybe even getting
some new features in. There's a very
[non-fancy Blog](blog/index.html) 
here on the site that has
announcements and a [low-traffic RSS
feed](blog/index.rss).

Visit the
[community page](community.html) for
details of mailing lists and other
ways to get in touch or find out
what is going on.
