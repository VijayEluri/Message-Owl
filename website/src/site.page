# How it works
</div>
<div class="right" markdown="1">
The *{project_name:}* documentation and site is created using [WebGen](http://webgen.rubyforge.org/) and is stored in git in the same [source control system as the code](source.html)
</div>

# Editing the source code
</div>
<div class="right" markdown="1">
If you [grab the source code](source.html) you can get the site source in the *website* directory.
If you have webgen installed (see below for instructions) then you can build the website from [the code](source.html) as follows

    cd {project_id:}/website
    webgen
  
The site will then be available in the *out* directory.

If you want to edit the files in your text editor and be able to immediately see the site re-rendered in a browser then use [rake](http://rake.rubyforge.org/) to run the site construction in a loop whenever it detects a file change.

    cd {project_id:}/website
    rake auto
    
You can now surf the site and see changes immediately. *Caveat* - sometimes rake doesn't rebuild the site each time. I'm not sure why that happens, but there are situations when it seems to miss the file change and you may need to interrupt the rake command and re-run it.

# Easy deploy using WebDAV
</div>
<div class="right" markdown="1">
A quick and easy way to deploy the site files is to mount the site location using the WebDAV capabilities of your OS. I develop on MacOS and if I have some small changes to make to the site, I mount it remotely as the *out* directory of the website build. This renders directly to the site. *Caveat* this is you editing the site *live*, so don't mess it up!

    cd {project_id:}/website
    mount -t webdav http://fusesource.com/forge/dav/msgo out

To do the webdav mount you will need to authenticate yourself as a Message Owl committer.

If you don't want to hack on the live site, and it's a nice plan not to, just mount the site location onto another directory on your disk. Then, when you have finished making site tweaks, just copy all of the content of the *out* directory to this mount point to deploy. Make sure you copy the content of the *out* directory and not the content of the *src* directory! It's been done before!

*Note* - if you are using MacOS X, there's something the matter with DAV copying using the Finder. If you attempt to copy from one Finder window to another which is looking at a WebDAV mount, it will say it succeeded, but all of the copies will be zero bytes. Instead, use the Terminal.app and command line to *cp -r* the content.

# Installing WebGen
</div>
<div class="right" markdown="1">
Before running the webgen command above you need to install it.

    sudo gem install webgen

You also need to install the following gems

    sudo gem install --source http://gems.github.com FooBarWidget-mizuho
    sudo gem install coderay
    sudo gem install feedtools
    sudo gem install haml

You can also install *sitecopy* to help deploy the site, although I find the WebDAV approach a lot easier.

    sudo port install sitecopy
</div>
